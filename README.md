# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./readme-files/logo-main.png) Final 1 - URL shortner ðŸ“Ž

In this project I created my own [URL shortener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening)!

You can find the finished project [here](https://url-shortener.ilaytissona.repl.co/)

Great thanks to Repl.it service for hosting.

## Short URLS - of course

Enter full URL, click on Go and get a short URL matching the URL you entered.

Whenever someone will browse to your shortened URL, he will get redirected to the full one you entered.

If the full URL has already been shortened sometime before, you will get the existing short URL, no duplications.

## Statistics table

When entering the site for the first time, a table with all existing short URLS is printed to the screen.

The table is updating in real time, so if someone else adds a URL to the list, it will appear on your screen in a few seconds.

There is an option to search for a shortened URL, and get all data only for this one (full URL, shortened URL, creation time, and clicks count).

Search bar accepts either ID only (3MckL) or full short URL (https://url-shortener.ilaytissona.repl.co/api/short/3MckL)

There is also an option to sort table by time of creation or by popularity.

Short URLS column has a "click to copy" functionality, to easily copy the short URL you want to publish.
